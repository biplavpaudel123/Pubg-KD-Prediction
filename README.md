# Pubg-KD-Prediction
Our team had worked on this for academic project at 3rd year of our Computer Engineering. I was learning MERN stack. 

I have implemented some of my skills related to Nodejs and express for creating a server which takes the player name from the website form and passes it to Pubg PC's official api to get the player statistics. It was then fed to  python file as input via our express backend. The python file passes the input to a model which my friends trained and predicts the kd of the player. The output of the Python file is then fetched and request is served.
